# A Star Alogrithm
A Star pathfinding implementation in java using processing library.  
I have optimized this as much as I could.

## Usage
The `Application` file can be run using `java` in command line in any OS.
For Linux, I have created a `run.sh` script, which can be used for the same.
For more control over things like _grid size_, _heuristic function_, _whether to check diagonals or not_, you can edit the source code under `src` folder and then build it with `javac` on any OS. Again, I have created a `build.sh` script, which can be run on Linux for the same purpose.
